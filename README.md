- Technologies used : Github, Git and Gitflow

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites ‚ôªÔ∏è

- A personal computer connected to the internet;
- Have a working and updated browser.
- Have a local version control like git installed on your computer
- Have an account on Github, as an online/remote Version Control System
- Code editor (Visual studio code, sublime text, notepad++, ...) installed on your computer;
- To be okay with javaScript ES6
- Knowledge of HTML and CSS.

### Setup

- Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone` command
- Use this link to clone it `https://github.com/Graycemuthui/Grocerypick.git`

### Live Demo

- Here is a link to the live demo [link](captain-hook-nine.vercel.app)

### Install

- Install all the dependencies using `npm install`

## Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Deployment

This project is deployed on Vercel. You can find the link to the live demo above.
